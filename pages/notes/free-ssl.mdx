# Node + Express + LetsEncrypt: Generate a free SSL certificate

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Most often, your host will provide a one-click solution to setup and renew SSL
  certificates on your server. But if like me you’re working on a VPS, you’ll
  have to deal with it manually.
</Callout>

### What you actually came for

**First**, you need those few things:

- A server running on a linux distribution with root access (via SSH)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)

<Steps>
### Check your distribution

make sure all of your dependencies are up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Install NodeJS

Then, you need to install `NodeJS LTS`, I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your NodeJS versions:

```bash
# Installing NVM
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
# Reload your shell
exec $SHELL
# Installing the latest LTS version
nvm install --lts
```

### Install Certbot

install `Certbot`:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot -y
```

### Verify your domain

Now, you will generate an SSL certificate with certbot:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --manual
```

<PostImage src={GENERATE_SSL_STEP_01} alt="generate ssl step 01" />

Type your domain name(s) without the protocol part.

For instance: **cool.yourdomain.com** or even **\*.yourdomain.com**.

<PostImage
  src={GENERATE_SSL_STEP_02_VERIFY_DOMAIN}
  alt="generate ssl step 02 verify domain"
  containerHeight="16rem"
/>

Note two things :

1. **a-string** : The name of the file you have to create, right now. Just create it, we’ll take care of the directories later.
2. **a-challenge**: Open the file you just created and put this challenge string into it. Nothing else, just this challenge string.

**Now, don’t continue. You need to run a web server with Node & Express.**

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Keep your terminal opened somewhere
</Callout>

- **Create a directory** with the name you want, e.g : server
- **In this directory, create a JS file which will run your server.** Keep it empty for the moment as I’ll provide you with a ready-to-copy/paste source code.
- In this directory, create two directories : .well-known , and inside this one, create : acme-challenge .
- In the directory : acme-challenge place the file you created before : **a-string**

This is what you should have :

```bash
.
└── server/
    ├── .well-known/
    │   └── acme-challenge/
    │       └── a-string
    └── index.js
```

#### You’re almost done !

Use your favorite code editor and copy-paste this code and run it :

```javascript
// Dependencies
const express = require("express");

// Configure & Run the http server
const app = express();

app.use(express.static(__dirname, { dotfiles: "allow" }));

app.listen(80, () => {
  console.log("HTTP server running on port 80");
});
```

To verify that everything is fine, open up your browser and navigate to : **http://cool.yourdomain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/a-string**

Your browser should download your challenge file. If it’s not the case, take everything back from the start. Don’t touch your shell, restart from directory & file creation.

If everything is okay, go back to your shell and type **ENTER**.

Certbo will verify your DNS and generate your certificate. Your certificate will be stored in the directory : **/etc/letsencrypt/live/cool.yourdomain.com/**

#### Verify via DNS

You can verify via DNS directly with domain like **\*.yourdomain.com**.

<PostImage
  src={GENERATE_SSL_STEP_02_VERIFY_DNS}
  alt="generate ssl step 02 verify dns"
  containerHeight="26rem"
/>

follow the instructions and you’ll be fine.

</Steps>
